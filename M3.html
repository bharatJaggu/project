    he RX100 designation was originally used in certain markets for the five-speed,<br>
     short-stroke 97cc Yamaha RS100DX produced from 1977. <br>
     This was an RS100 (itself a 1976 improvement upon the design of the original reed-valved 96cc RS100 that was introduced to the United Kingdom in September, 1974, <br>
     and to the USA in November, 1974)[1][2] with a front disc brake and a tachometer, and was replaced in 1983 with the square-stroke, <br>
     98cc RX-S (with part numbers coded 31J),[3] a major update on the RS design (with substantial changes particularly to the cylinder, <br>
     head, and induction, and the points ignition replaced by Yamaha Capacitor Discharge Ignition) which was to form the basis of the<br>
      Escort-distributed variants including the EY-100 Escort Yamaha 100. The Escort variants of the RX-S had heavier gauge steel tubing <br>
      and other changes specific to the Indian market, including slotted screws instead of the original Phillips. Names of older variants <br>
      of the RS line were re-used for Escort variants of the RX-S, including RX100 and RX-Z (a designation first used for a version of the <br>
      first-generation RS100 updated with Capacitor Discharge Ignition)<br>

Following the poor sales of the Rajdoot 350, <br>
Yamaha needed to make a new product, <br>
and the recent success of Suzuki's AX 100 <br>
demonstrated the potential of small-capacity motorbikes in India.<br>
</p>
<p>
In India in November 1985, <br>
Yamaha released the RX 100 (a variant of the RX-S, not the original RX100 or RS100DX) to widespread acclaim. <br>
The appeal came largely from the high output of its 100 cc (6.1 cu in) engine. With its lightweight body and high power output, <br>
the resulting power to weight ratio of the bike made it the best 100 cc bike ever built for mass production, and as a <br>
result there is still a high demand for it many years after it ceased production.<br>
